# 📦 TeacherHub (Internal Management System)

## 🧭 Overview
**TeacherHub** is a secure, Windows-based internal application developed during my university social service at ICC School. It manages teacher profiles, replacing manual, paper-based processes with a fully digital system.

TeacherHub centralizes teacher personal data, professional experience, and academic background for administrative staff, enhancing information retrieval, operational efficiency, and security.
