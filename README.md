# 📦 TeacherHub

## 🧭 Overview
**TeacherHub** is a Windows-based application developed as part of my social service for my university. Built for ICC School, this application streamlines the management of teacher records by replacing manual, paper-based processes with a digital system. The app enables administrative staff to add, update, delete, and search teacher profiles—all hosted internally to ensure secure access.

## 💡 Idea & Concept
The project was initiated to address the inefficiencies and challenges associated with managing paper-based teacher records. TeacherHub aims to:
- Digitize comprehensive teacher information.
- Eliminate document duplication and confusion over outdated resumes.
- Enhance administrative efficiency through a centralized, digital system.
- **Secure Access:** Implement a login and access control system to ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive documentation. All login credentials and communications are encrypted to provide an extra layer of security.

The initial scope focused on a robust CRUD module for managing teacher profiles, with plans for additional modules (e.g., talent search for non-employed teachers and attendance tracking) to further support the school's administrative needs.

## ✨ Features & Functionality
- **Teacher CRUD Module:** Full functionality to create, read, update, and delete teacher profiles.
- **Detailed Profiles:** Each profile includes:
  - General personal information
  - Interests
  - Photographs
  - Academic qualifications (studies, courses, languages)
  - Hobbies
  - Family information
  - Previous work experience
- **Secure Login & Access Control:** A dedicated login system prevents external or unauthorized internal access to sensitive documentation. All access credentials and communications are encrypted.
- **Future Modules (Planned):**
  - Talent search for teachers not currently employed by the school.
  - Attendance tracking to monitor teacher presence.
